"The Mi Dual driver headphones delivers more than expected on one aspect - Bass. And there's bucket loads of it and that too without compromising too much on clarity.
This is my initial impression after using this headphone for almost 4 hours continuously. I will update this review with all other aspects and comparisons once I burn this in.

Edit : 9th March2020:
Before going into the review I own Mi in ear headphones pro, Vsonic GR02 Bass edition, Signature Acoustics Elements V2.1, Sennheisser HD598 SE, Realme Buds 2 and had Soundmagic E10. So I think I know a few things related to headphones when I compare them.
1. Design : Fairly standard design with a Y connector cable, 125 cm long braided cable which does not entangle and unfolds very easily. Kudos to that. I previously had Mi in ear headphones pro which entangled like anything. But from the splitter onward the cable is rubber and it does entangle a bit, but that potion is less luckily. The earbuds are made of anodised aluminium with rubber eartips. The ear buds does have magnets like realme earbuds and are relatively strong and helps to keep them stay together. No magnetic on off feature present.
2. Comfort : Nothing much to brag about here. It is comfortable like any other earphone and you'll be able to sleep on your side while wearing it.
3. Sound : BASS, BASS, BASS. That is what this is made for. It is dark and has tons of it.
Mids and high - the mids and high are somewhat overpowered by the bass which is bloated at times. But for the price it is OK. The male voice especially nasal tones seem a little upfront and unpleasant at times. For audiobooks and podcasts, it's easier to hear even in outdoors. The high or treble is where all the problems are. The treble is almost nonexistent. You'll need to adjust your equalizer a little bit to get the desired amount of treble to your liking.
Sound stage- affected by the bloated bass and less treble. The sound seems to be center staged and differentiating between instruments seems difficult.
4. Sound Isolation: Decent and comparable with others in the same price range.
5. Mic- It is of quite good quality with the person at the other end never experiencing any difficulties. The sound was very clear without much background noises and was clear. The mic is present in the right-side cable.
6. Value for money: this is a decent buy at a price of 799rs.

Final words: This headphone is made for the BASS-lovers. There is so much bass that it overpowers almost everything else. If you want a more round bodied sound you'll have to fiddle with the equaliser a little bit and once you does that you have got a decent pair of headphones with a very good mic. Even though a dual driver earphone, it doesn't live up to its name or its advertisements. Out of the box, it has nothing but bass. You'll get a much better sound in Sennheiser CX180, but it doesn't have a mic. For the price of 799, you have got a headphone which is better than the Boats Bassheads 225 and Realme buds 2. BUT, if you patiently wait and watch for lightning deals, you may find the Signature Acoustics Elements C12 version 2.1 @ 749 rs which is an absolute gem and trumps the Mi earphone on every aspect except for the muddy bass which is very clear in it. Also you get a foam tip with the signatures which in itself costs more than 200rs each pair.

So, the decision is all yours. For you, bass lovers, go ahead and buy it, you won't regret it. For pure sound lovers/audiophiles stay away.
Take your buying decision wisely.

"I use it for long term use... Wired earphone always better than Bluetooth in terms of health.. I think I can feel Bluetooth waves interfering with my brain... So yes...
Also sounds great... I love the braided cable... You know wires get damaged easily, but if you can protect the upper non braided cable then it will be okay... I have 2 of them and my previous earphone (dual driver) got damaged from the controler where there is mic... So it skips songs automatically often...

"First thing, bass is just üí•
But then I realised that my 150rs Zebronics earphone has much clearer voice than this mi. And that too without any dual drivers.

"First of all I would like to request you all to first let the earphones to burn to its full so as to extract all its potential from these pair of earphones. At first when I bought these pair of earphones, I was not at all impressed with its performance. The bass seemed to be too high and the vocals and the highs seemed to be suppressed. But after continuous usage the sound quality improved greatly.
Previously I have used several other earphones like Sennheiser CX 213, Sennheiser HD 202 II, Sennheiser CX2.00G, Sony MDR EX110, Boats Bassheads 225, Realme Buds 2, etc. Among all of them I found the sound signature of Sennheiser to be the best. But the only complaint was the built quality as the wire quality of Sennheiser is not upto the mark. So after the Sennheiser CX 2.00G got damaged due to the wear and tear of its wires, I decided not to invest much money on earphones and searched for cheaper alternatives. So I bought Realme Buds 2 after a extensive research which cost me less than 5 times of my Sennheiser CX 2.00G. I just loved the sound quality of the Realme Buds 2 earphones. Since my sister urgently needed a pair of earphone I gifted her those after a brief period of use of less than a month.
While looking to buy a new pair of earphones since it is difficult for me to carry around the Sennheiser HD 202 II, I came across the Mi Dual Driver. The name itself caught my fancy and so I ordered it immediately by going through some YouTube reviews. But to my utter surprise these pair of earphones doesn't live up to its name and my expectations. Although they are dual driver they lacks the clarity in the vocals which one would expect from a dual driver earphone. The bass is too much for my liking as it overshadows the vocals and the treble. I myself use a Redmi K20 Pro smartphone and I tweaked the Equalizer of my phone and reduced the bass and tuned the highs to match it to my taste. But still I feel the vocals to be not crisp enough. From this perspective I would rather prefer the Realme Buds 2 over the Mi Dual Driver anyday due to its balanced sound signature.
One thing that Mi Dual Driver does better is retaining the minute details in the music and it also does a better job if you play a song at high volume as the sound doesn't get distorted which is bit of an issue with the Realme Buds 2.

Moreover, the call quality via the microphone of the Mi Dual Driver is very good but I would have preferred the inline remote to be flat though since it is quite difficult to detect the buttons as they are very slim.

At the end of this review I would recommend anyone looking for a pair of earphones providing balanced audio quality without compromising on the mids and the high at this price point to go for Realme Buds 2 or otherwise if they are bassheads than they can go for these without any second thought.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"The headphone is better built than the Sennheiser sound quality is good, but the Sennheiser is just more accurate and clean sounding.

Pros:
Decent Sound

Sleeved cables, better build quality than jbl or Sennheiser

Cons:
the 3.5 mm jack is longer so may have issues going all the way in, for a few phones.

"Using this pair from 2 months previously i used Sony mdr ex 150 ap And Jbl T series and Blaupunkt Em-10 all of these earphones are really sounds good and i love all those 3 but but but those are not durable ! every pair of those got damaged in 3-6 months.
So now i decided to buy a durable earphones this time ! (Only wired)
On my small research i found Realme buds2 and this Mi dual driver are durable because of braded cable one of my friends are using Realme pair so i want to go with Mi pair and #DualDriver which is very good on paper, so orderd this pair
And using this pair from 2+ months

Coming to sound quality - which is good but not very good !

We dont notice it as dual driver as mi claimed, it feels like any other single driver earphones in market

We can able to enjoy good quality until volume level is upto 70
Sound stage is good at that low to medium volume so we can feel that instrument seperation very clearly and we can feel the distance of sound
But but but at high volumes the Sound stage is ZERO we cannot found any instrument seperation and there is no direction for that sounds

Coming to Bass the bass is Avarage (to) good i would say trust me there is bass but there is no punch in that bass
Then those who loves bass music and Edm's will disappoint with this pair i prefer Blaupunkt EM-10 at this price point

L shaped jack is another plus
Magnetic heads are another plus

Finally i found these earphones decent !
This earphones will suit for those who loves melody's and Mid old songs

But i found these earphones are durable and i trust Mi service also ((I found jbl service is unavailable for many people like me))

I like earbuds also which are very different structure and very soft meterial

And i rate these earphones audio 3.3/5
But for durability 5/5

I hope this review will helps you !",4.0 out of 5 stars

The one thing this earphones disappoint is the wire, half wire is braided which is good but the others half is not braided and it breaks at split joint after a year and the wire isn't straight either it's ll curvey due to its packaging and it will stay curvey forever and tangled easily.",3.0 out of 5 stars
"Long Review:-
Delivery:- Delivery was swift and in a good position.

Initial impressions:- The product was ok, braided cable and 90 degree jack was good, on the other side there is no protection at a place where long cable meets 2 small earpiece cables which can tear easily on daily usage. 3 sets of ear plugs given where medium will be attached with the earphones. Volume down buttons seems to be little bit not okay when compared to other buttons.

Sound:- A very big disappointment when i compared it with Jbl c200si. Normals users can't find any difference but if you are a jbl user jumping into this, you will be totally disappointed. No rich vocals, bass is okay, calls are okay, didn't get any signature sound experience here.

Overall review:- if you are okay with normal quality music, need that 3 button switch and braided cable, you can go for this, if you are true music lover and want to experience each and every bit of music, go for jbl endurance or jbl c200si....

Its purely my opinion, you can research before buying one.",3.0 out of 5 stars

"1. Sound- Overall sound quality is good but bass is not that rich. I am not a basshead but still I din not satisfy with its bass. Vocals are clear and instrument separations can be identified well and sometimes the sound of dual drivers can be felt.
2. Built quality- Overall built quality was fantastic. There is no any issue with the braided cable and the gold plated L shaped headphone jack. But the quality of the upper wires can be improved. The quality of metalic earbuds is awesome and the magnetics are decently strong.
3. Mic Quality- This is the best part of these headphones. The microphone is superb in quality. I compared its microphone with the microphones of another earphones. You can never complaint about its mic.
4. Comfort- In case of comfort I can not say its great. Because of metalic earbuds these headphones become a little heavier and if your ears are small the metalic part of earbuds will touch your ears and make it more uncomfortable.
Overall conclusion- If you are finding an earphone with premium looks and good built quality and clear vocal with instrument separations then go for it. Also if you want to record songs with its microphone then blindly go for it. It provides the best microphone in this price range. But if you are expecting deep bass then avoid it. I am returning it because of little uncomfortable for me and also for a little bit poor bass quality.
Have a Good Day.

"After using a pair of AKG earphones and realme buds 2, here are my overall product conclusions/comparisons.

Design (My rating 9/10)
These earphones have a good enough build quality and have a good ear fit. They don't look as good as the realme buds 2 but in the long run they should be more durable than those because of the 90 degree aux connector and thicker earphone wire casing.
The buds fit in very well and the extra tips are extremely useful. Overall these are comfortable enough to sleep in. The AKG's are the worst designed followed by these and the Realme Buds 2 come out on top of this category.

Sound (My rating 7/10)
These are pretty decent sounding in comparison to the other two wired earphones I've used but lean more towards the bass sound profile.
The mids and highs are a little faint in comparison but with the right use of equalizer tuning is fairly easy.
The Realme Buds 2 slightly sound better and the AKG's are the best in this category.

Durability (My rating 10/10)
My AKG's and Realme Buds 2 both had the same problem over the course of 2 years, the braided part was always fine but the joints near the connector and the earphones always used to wear badly. In terms of comparison I think these should do better because of the angled aux port and thicker wire casing.
This category is completely dominated by the Mi buds followed by the Realme Buds2 and then the AKG's",4.0 out of 5 stars

My realme buds 2's wire (above splitter) got cut just by putting in and out of the pocket and bags and stopped working within a month meanwhile these with same treatment are still working.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"These are good value for money, doing what is expected without any exceptional qualities. I have used similar priced Mi earphones of an older model before, these have some good upgrades
Pros:
1) build quality is decent, plastic body with lower part of the cables braided makes it feel stronger. Right angled pin is a good thing to have to avoid it coming in the way while using a device. 3 sized eartips in the package, to customise for fit, provided in a plastic pouch
2) sound quality is good and balanced. Music and lyrics sound even, one does not overpower the other, bass is not prominent. Good for listening to spoken audio and music.
3) call quality is good, based on my testing. People at the other end could hear me well, and so could I. Three button remote is great for adjusting call and music volume without having to reach for the phone (this does not work on iOS devices, but no issues with audio transmission and regular play/pause/ call answer) there are some extra features with long press for android devices mentioned in user manual in box.
4) The magnets on the earbuds is a good addition, useful to maage while wearing and good for small amount of cable management while not in use to avoid tangles
Cons:
1) the earphones come in a simple soft cardboard box, Mi earphones used to come in a hard plastic box earlier which was good for storage but not any longer, no carry pouch either. Storage is up to you, which may affect damage and longevity. Storing extra eartips also is an issue because of this. A carry pouch would be good
2) the pin on the sockets are dependable, in my past experience they last for about a year butbyiubhave to be careful with pulling on them since this is the weakest point of the earphones in my opinion.
3) the braiding on the cake is only on the lower part, after the divider into two sections for each ear it is soft rubber like plastic. This part is more susceptible to breaking, especially at the earbuds end where we ususally have the second most common point of failure.",4.0 out of 5 stars

But you wont get that sound stage and a lack of crisp in the quality...

I loved it cuz now I can sleep with it on without worrying. I also felt the bass was too much and Treble was less until I stopped using MIUI. I discovered MiUi does something that makes the bass comes out more so if you use an another device, it sounds great. Or probably u might use the device Equalizer to tune it up. I love it. And I can just say to go for it. U won't believe, I got an spare of this earphone in my cupboard.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Not good for music lovers(they can try realme earphones they are good for media consumption)
But there is a serious problem on the build of this earphone. The volume up, volume down and pause/play button gets pressed without even touching.
The cable quality looks sus looks like it would break easily (but did not break in my case).

"I bought these as a replacement for my trusty Sennheiser CX-180. I switch between both of them depending on what I need them for. I'll list the pros and cons below.

Pros :
1: Treble and Low frequencies are absolutely perfect.
2: Sufficiently long cable, inline microphone.
3: Magnetic buds with convex and concave backs so you can tell which is right and left without needing to look.
4: Ear tips are soft, filtered design unlike other ear tips which are open mouth design.
5: Angled 3.5mm connector for ergonomics as well as durability.

Cons :
1: Mid range frequency isn't great.
2: Headphone cable is braided only halfway, tangles almost immediately where the braid ends.
3: Inline microphone and buttons are poorly designed. The cylinder shape that holds it is unnecessarily large, the buttons have no tactile difference between the three buttons so you'll definitely end up pressing pause instead of volume up/down.
4: The plastic housing of each bud isn't comfortable in ear. Within a matter of minutes you can feel the plastic pressing in your ear. I've changed tips as well as used third party tips, so no change.
5: To make place for the dual drivers the housing is large so also is cause for considerable weight and poor comfort.

Use this if you need it for very short travels that have a lot of outside noise. Good for gaming too due to the inline microphone.

Overall I still prefer my CX-180 for comfort and sound quality even though it doesn't have mic. Also Sennheiser warranty is 2 Years vs 6 Months for these.",4.0 out of 5 stars

I have buyed this product on 23-10-2021. After using of 3 to 4 month the problem started which is front person can't hear me properly until i keep the mic very close to my mouth. And inspite of keeping my mic close to my mouth the volume is not that much high which front person can hear. Also warranty is not mentioned here in Amazon and when i talked to Mi customer care they told me that warranty is only for 6 month. I would suggest go for crossloop headphones they are better than this and they are providing 1 year warranty. I have used crossloop headphones as well and i was satisfied with them. I regret that i have tried this Mi headphones. Hope my review will help someone to take the correct decision on this mi headphones.,2.0 out of 5 stars

"Prons
1.Great Sound Quality feels good
2.Amazing bass when we adjust equalizer
3.Mic is perfect
4.Wire quality is good
5.L shape audio jack prevents damaging good
6.Earbuds is soft and didn't get any discomfort or pain while using.
7.Great for music and movies dual driver works really great.

Cons
1.Mic and volume button is not great for user friendly but good
2.When you go in full volume there is little disortion but thats not the problem it doesnt gives any disortion at 80% volume,this level sound is loud and highly enough for hearing songs for long time.

Overall its worth for its price.Most of the youtubers told realme buds 2 is great but I don't think so I used realme buds too it is also good but only difference between mi dual driver and realme buds is realme default has good bass than mi dual driver but when we adjust equalizer in mi dual driver its sound amazing Definitely go for it.",5.0 out of 5 stars

"My thorough review of MI Dual Driver earphone after using it for a month, 3-4 (Approx.) Hours in a day. This review is based on the following parameters;
1. Overall Sound Quality 8/10
2. Bass 8/10
3. Sound clarity (Vocals, Mids, Highs) 9/10
4. Build Quality 9/10
5. Value for money. 8.5/10
Pros: Sound Quality, Build Quality, Tangle free wire Quality
Cons: As these earphones are heavy (metallic earphone chambers) you can‚Äôt wear them for more than 2 to 2.5 hours continuously.
These earphones actually proves what they claim, these are dual driver earphones and segregate the multiple instrument sounds clearly and separately. I have experienced sounds of many hidden instruments that were not audible in Realme Buds 2 and Sennheiser HD 602.
Bass is important part of the music but it should not be the only parameter to judge the sound quality of any Headphone/earphone.
MI dual driver earphone is a device that will provide you balanced, clear and loud music. For most of the sound tracks you can‚Äôt even raise volume to 100% level, even at 100% volume there are no signs of distortion, not even 0.1%.
I have seen many people complaining about the sound quality, for Redmi users I would suggest to go to Settings->Sound & Vibration->Sound effects, now turn on the MI Sound Enhancer and select ""MI in ear Pro"" from the option. Once done then you will get the real sound, real bass and dose of real music.
I will give 8.5/10 to MI dual driver earphone and trust me this the best choice in earphones under 1000 Rs. Its stands ahead of Sony, JBL, Sennheiser and Realme Buds 2 ""under"" Rs 1000 category.
Additional Tip: To test your earphones quality download ""Earphones Test+"" from play store and judge the quality of any earphone at your own.",5.0 out of 5 stars

"I have been using Sennheiser CX-180 for last two years, and have become really fade up with their cheap material quality. Finally, I decided to buy this one. Used for almost 1 hour, way better ! Braided cable really doesn't get tangled that easily, sound quality is also good, maybe Bass is lightly higher, but I have to use it more to know that. The buttons do their work as intended (because I have used lots of other earpieces whose button functions are puzzling), however, sometimes the buttons may feel stiff (I don't know maybe it's my way of pressing). The audio quality during calls also went off smoothly, although noise cancellation might be an issue with people who want ABSOLUTE SILENCE, because this is DOESN'T PROVIDE ABSOLUTE SILENCE, although it comes very near to it (of course, depends on the environment one is using).
OVERALL, a nice product at this budget, packaging was nice and crisp, like with all Mi products. Hopefully, it will be better than the CX-180.",4.0 out of 5 stars

"Writing this review after close to a month of use.
The dual driver is for real. As the sound separation is very nice.. but need to use some equalizer to get the balance right. Because the bass is heavy. It's very heavy to the point that you need to lower the volume just to save your ears (If you want to have hearing ability for at least few more years). I love to explore new earphones and headphones and this one is very good for the money.

"Don't buy if you are an audiophile, it definitely disappoint you.
This earphones are not that high quality becoz i connected to quad 32 bit amplifier in theory it must sound good but practically it is opposite to these buds
Why i dont know left ear bud is buzzing i thought it is my product problem so i replaced still i see the same buzzing sound in left bud, maybe it is design problem
Finally i say if you plan to buy these use for low end phones or low end devices, i don't suggest for high end phones or any amplifiers also
And mainly it is only made for music not for gaming
Final review
Bass is good
Mids, vocals are ok but high volume mixes all
And highs are swallowed by driver not that great
I am an audiophile though.
I use 1more quad driver, triple driver neck band, 1more tws and lot of sony headsets, comparing to these isn't good bcoz these are just 800 still lot of alternatives are there here like
Sony
Sennheiser
1more piston
And more to go",4.0 out of 5 stars
These earphones sound good enough for the price but they are not for everyone. Make sure you check them in terms of ear fit beacause they could hurt your ears if you use them for long time. And braided cable is not as good as you might expect. They are good enough for normal use but not recommended to use them for harsh environments or rough use they might eventually wearoff. It could reduce outside noise for a very low level but you can hear people at 60 percent volume. You have to increase sound to avoid outside noise. It is not completely tangle free but it is good at what it can offer for price.,3.0 out of 5 stars

This earphones are best to play BGMI. It has better sound quality and noise cancellation. My brother and me we both play BGMI but first footstep comes in my ear and in his realme buds 2 it comes afterwards. The drawback is it fix in my ear properly but when I put off this earphones my ears are paining but it is not too much paining after 5 mins it's over,4.0 out of 5 stars
"I have been using a JBL C200SI and Sony MDR-EX150AP since an year and my review is based on the comparison among the 3.
The earpieces in MI are huge and heavy at the back, probably because of the dual drivers or useless magnets, which makes them fall out frequently while just moving the head. When the fit is poor it fails to block the outside noise as too. It comes with 3 extra tips and none of them worked. I tried using ear tips from other earphones I have but no luck.
About the quality, there is nothing special about the Bass as they are advertising (tried on Samsung S8 and no EQ, it might do better on MI phone with EQ). It is equal to JBL C200SI, but lacks in overall clarity. Mids and highs are overpowered by the bass. It's only the cable strength which I liked which is better then both Sony and JBL. I have not tested the mic.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"My honest opinion about this earphone is pretty good... Since i bought this earphone in 11st August... Almost it's 3 moths in use...
Very satisfied with this earphone...
Biught it in 799...all things are pretty good..
Happy facts: 1-Build quality(braided cable from the jack to the microphone) , don't worry about the earpiece wore it's pretty strong though)
2-Microphone quality is amazing.. The best part is it's position.. Right in front of your mouth makes a perfect distant audio while in call or while singing etc
3-Bass quality is as promised.. But it's not like dual driver as MI claimsüòâ... But there is no major difference in quality like Vocals, instruments etc
4- 3.5mm jack has also updated from last year (those who bought the 699 variant in past) it's really actual L-SHAPE... Seems pretty sturdy
5-Magnetic buds with premium color finish gives a premium look with compatibility

Things that i don't like....
1-Last year the 699 variant came with the metal volume up n down with microphone box as shown in picture.. But this year they gave the plastic one... Only the microphone circuit area.... But that's nit a deal breaker for me...
2- About pricing... If the earphone was between 700 to 750..it will be a great deal for all people or other customers

Lastly i highly recommend you guys thus earphone.. It can last easily 1 to 1.8 years in a rough use...
The previous 699 variant i bought is still working abiut 2years for now...

"Waited much for this product since the time I ordered for it. I checked the sound quality, bass and mic quality for hands free calling. There is no significant difference in the output sound quality when compared to others in this price segment. One should not expect something different out of its dual driver set up. Turn off the equalizer and test the sound quality in the mid-volume. Noise Cancellation is the core feature which has drawn my attention and it made me buy this one. Honestly, it is not up to the mark in terms of noise cancellation. Bass quality is too good. If you are a bass lover, you can go with it. Build quality with the braided cable is good.
Overall, the product is a decent one at this price and it won't disappoint you if you don't expect much from the title ""dual driver"". Well it can be given 7/10 as an over all rating.",4.0 out of 5 stars

"Writting this review after using this earphones for hours.
Firstly Kudos to Amazon Customer services, they helped me a lot for issues regarding to this product.
but... delivery took lottttt of time and was not showing any update in 'order section'.
The product itself is quite good one.
Base is adequate.
lows - mids are nice as per considering the price. Voice and call quality is crisp and clear no issues while calling. Dual driver technology definitely stands out. Sound is crisp and perfect.
Build is phenomenal.
I've used Sennheiser (cx-180) and Sony(ex150AP).
Both of these have mediocre build and sound quality as compared to this one.

But one thing is not going good about this earphones...
The control button is not working at all.
I'm using Motorola x4 and audio jack isn't perfectly fitting.
every time i use it while walking or sitting in chair it gets disconnected and every time I've to plug it again and again.... it's so damn annoying.
&
I've no idea how to solve the control button issue.
May be I'll get it checked from MI Service Center.
Overall product is good and value for money.
No need to waste money on other products just go for this one..
It'll fullfill your requirements.

"I have already used mi earphone basic. After 1 year 6 month used mic was stoped working and next one side stoped working because i used very rough. The mic quality was really surprising i used that mic for youtube. That was a great deal of 399 so I ordered again mi basic earphone on 7th april but next day 8 th april i suddenly saw mi dual driver earphone @599 because of mi fan festival i think that was a great deal so i cancelled my mi basic earphone order and placed order for mi dual driver i got it by today 11th april.
I used that earphone that was great for 599 but idk is it worth for 799.
My thought was mi basic earphone and mi dual driver both are same in sound quality. Mi dual driver have extra Pros brided cable, 3 function button only. Mi basic earphone gives a great ear comfort but dual driver have slightly heavy in my ear.

For other things it's quite good.
FOR THE PRICE OF 799 AND 699 IN SALES(RARELY) IT'S BEST IN IT'S PRICE OVERALL.

but you can preffer REALME BUDS 2 if you don't use it while driving and keeping the 3.5 joint in stress . For that they are more value for money and even better for gaming.

They are lil bit more comfortable for longer sessions while these one are more classy but lose the paint on the edges pretty easily.

Have bought 3 pairs since the day it launched. And 3 things that is sure to fail in it and how to avoid them.

1. Right earpiece not working.

Make sure to not to pull the mic near your mouth for long durations ,it damages the right earphone.

""You can get it replaced under warranty thought""

2. The ""Y"" joint.

Make sure to not share the earphones with others. It breaks the joint and it's the most common thing that breaks.

""it won't be replaced under warranty.""

3.Mic button Malfunction

"There are two types of sound lovers one who's ear find high treble and find hard to hear the instruments if buried under decent bass .

No headphone apart from Sennheiser CX 213 and this redmi dual driver one could handle the extra thump so precisely. I love this pair of earbuds. Just terrific sound delivery. Obviously recommend for music purpose.

CON:
Not a very good option if you are willing to use it for conversation purposes. Picks up external sound so much that the person on the other end will end up having a head ache. Apart from this, it is truly a beast for delivering high quality music and premium bass.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Coming to the build quality after 1 month of heavy use I am a bit worried about the y spiltter because the metal earpieces are a bit heavy , it's a bit weak and the volume and pause buttons are not that clicky,these two are the only issues I have
Other pros are 1 . they feel premium
2. You will definitely notice the dual drivers are different",4.0 out of 5 stars
Best for 799 Rs I bought in sell for only 600. Best budget earphones. Cable quality in good. And L shape connecter in soo good I am using this earphones for 5 months and I don't have any issues. üëç,5.0 out of 5 stars
"Iam reviewing it after 7 months of rigorous use and can say, this is the best sturdy earphone in the budget segment of rs800.. Some pros and cons:-
PROS-
1.Sounds are properly balanced and no distortions are there... A balanced sound one will feel listening to any genre of music while at home or traveling.
2.It simple fites in the ears and is easier to wrap around your neck if you are traveling in crowded bus/train as it won't fall easily due to magnets.
3.While playing battleground games like free fire/pubg you can listen footsteps and directions of enemies easliy (but still would recommend to use other sound apps also available from playstore.. Bcoz it's not a pure gaming earphone).
4.While receiving calls you will hear proper and loud voice.Microphone quality is good.
5.Cables/wires quality used in the earphone is very good and the braided one is hard to tear..
CONS-
1.While you listen to any online classes or lectures in YouTube you will feel less sound a little bit. But that is not an issue.. You can simply increase the volume then.
2.Wires are 75-80% tangle free and not 100%.",5.0 out of 5 stars

"Hi
After using these earphones I feel there's no sense were they called dual-driver In new mi earphones because in past days I was using Realme Buds 2 which is amazing
sound quality good amount of bass but in this mi dual-drive I don't like it because not happy with noise cancellation the sound is very low that's my opinion, bass ok, or crinkly treble cannot listen most of the musical instruments so let's talking about comfort seriously guys worst experience if I wear it an hour to listening music or playing games like pubg you feel too much pain if your ear size small like me so before, buy these earphones then make sure you remember these things, I mentioned in review but in build, this is Good one Realme like Build Quality so there's no compromise with the build quality go for it if you like Mi.

Moreover there's no distortion at higher volumes so yeah that's a plus point. Also the magnetic tips is a good touch.

"New thing in this earphones is that you can listen to many other background sounds( instruments) when compared to other earphones but it is not that suited when you listen to EDM, Dubstep and Trap l. It makes those music noisy. When coming to PUBG since the sound is crispy it's good where you can hear footsteps. I would recommend it for PUBG and desi music but not for EDM kind of music. By the way Boat wireless has best base than mi regular earphones and dual driver earphone. I own them all and have used them.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"Everything is excellent with these headphones except for the part of the wires which doesn't come with braided protection. I am not saying that the wire is bad or dies quickly, as I have been using it already since few months without any issues. However, in a long run, you may notice, as I am noticing, that the unbraided part of the cable flattens when it gets twisted. This lits up a fear that the cable maybe a guest for only a short time. Fingers crossed. Xiaomi is a nice manufacturer though. :)",4.0 out of 5 stars

But it is not all good , The media buttons feel cheap and is not that clicky.

The sound quality is ok-ok. Not the best but it is good. The bass and treble is really good but the mids and vocals are not good. Its ok for gaming as well.

"I am not into vocals. However does a pretty decent job for playing them. The dual drivers does an amazing job for enjoying electronic music. Even when the BPM is around 180-220 the clarity does not change. Bass is thumping and does not seem to be over amplified. For electronic music lovers this is an amazing headsets given its price. Noise cancelation is not too good and not worse even. While driving bike with the headphones on the person end of the call can hear the background noise pretty clearly.

Best build quality, Dual driver earphone in budget price. the cable is braided and strong. Saw some reviews on youtube before buying and I think all those are misleading at least from a sound point of view. Have great bass, Can hear all instrumental sounds (high and low frequency) thanks to its dual driver. Noise cancelation is best. Surround sound effect and can notice the direction of the sound. for gaming also it is very clear and loud and it feels as if you are playing in the hall that's why some gamers didn't like this but as per my experience sound is very clear and crisp moreover it also depends on the in-game sound effects. Only one con is that the wire for the earphone after the separator is soft and feels delicate but I compared it with my old Xiaomi headphone it's the same and will be durable.",5.0 out of 5 stars

And as this is a dual driver earphone it shows its quality and in this price other brands are not going to give product like this to u.
Let's talk about build quality it has braded cable upto splitter as u can see in images and after the splitter the wire is of normal quality but good quality tangle free cable so not so noticeable.

I was confused between Mi Dual Driver Earphones and Realme Buds 2 for some time but after seeing the overwhelmingly positive reviews for Realme Buds 2 and some complains about how Mi Dual Driver Earphones make people's ear hurt, I decided to buy Realme Buds 2 and boy did I regret it! I absolutely hated it. Realme Buds 2 is only good for songs that have bass in it, otherwise produces a sort of ""sharp"" sound output, as it were, not one that works for me.

Mi Dual Driver however works for me. Its sound is more balanced and I have been listening to it for three hours straight now and I don't experience ear pain of any sort.

I recieved this on 11th may. Sound quality was okay for the price not much of a big difference. Talking about build quality it's very poor because the wires connected to the earphone is very delicate and the joints were not properly sealed. So, if you're a rough user never go for it.And in gaming it just sucks I couldn't hear clear footsteps of enemys. so, I couldn't predict their current position. Only mic quality is good nothing more.
After 2.5 months the right side of the earphone stopped working but still it was working.
Verdict-It's not for gamers and rough users. I won't recommend anyone to buy this earphone.
Currently I'm using oneplus bullets wireless z. It's way more better:)",3.0 out of 5 stars
"Build quality is great in this price range. But the sound quality is not good as expected, bass is good and deep also but the worst point is clarity and mids are muddy.
Normal person may not agree with me who never ussed or experienced good audio quality. Sounds similar with mi basic which costs half (around 399-450) Only thing is good in this earphone is build quality. Better go with jbl, schenheizer, audio technica, etc",4.0 out of 5 stars
I like the sound clarity and first of all I like that Punching bass from the earphones are next level. Cable build quality is super. Voice mic is also working perfectly. Though the ear piece is slightly weight. But I love the overall build quality is awesome!!

"1st Disappointing Matter is I ordered Blue colour,they gave me Black one

But I didn't exchanged I left that thought because Amazon provided me a lot of Fine deals in Good Price points so With smile I accepted that product

I don't know whether you guys accept me or not but the Passive noise cancellation And Sound of this ""MI DUEL DRIVER"" better than my ""SKULLCANDY HESH 3"" Bluetooth over the hear Headphone, You may wonder about the price Range 8000 INR and 700INR But it's fact according me.

The frequency range from Mids to highs Even at high volume ( don't use in high volume ) no distortion in sound.

Excluding the colour rejection am Cent % happy with this accessory",5.0 out of 5 stars
"First of all the comfort is good with these earphones and the sound quality is decent too, braided cable is fine but the dual cables after the joint is too delicate, if you're planning buy these you should know these are not upto the mark build quality wise and they definitely do not win against realme buds 2 but don't get me wrong these sound so good I never felt any ear ache.

"Yes, these are turned bad from the factory.
Out of the box, there's lack of treble, bass depends on your phone's eq settings.... point is earphones sound slightly different on different phones.

Make sure to tune your equalizer settings before you judge these, on mine I ramped treble all the way up and bass half way and these sound WAY better, treble is nice, instrument separation is good too and bass is lovely.
I say fiddle with your equalizer all you want, you'll love these.",5.0 out of 5 stars

"PROS
1. Sound Quality is excellent. Noise Cancellation is decent.
2. Mic is quite good and calls are clear.
3. Build Quality is too good for the price.
4. Braided Cable and Magnets make the earphones tangle free.

CONS
1. Volume control buttons do not work on iOS. Only Mic and Play/Pause button work.
This is not mentioned anywhere. Quite misleading.
2. The braided Cable is only till the part where the cable splits. Could've carried it over to all wires.",3.0 out of 5 stars
"Directly Pros & Cons:
Pros:
Half braided wire.
'L' shaped plugin.
dual driver works perfect.
Good Noise cancellation.
Magnetic buds.
Gold Plated pin.
Play-Pause and Volume Up & Down buttons.

Extreme bass.
So Loud.

Cons:
Half braided wire.
Thin buds' wires, no braid.
Buttons are inlined so can't recognise which button is pause play or volume button.
not that good for treble lovers, treble is decent. If you want good response then you can use any EQ app.

"Cannot expect more at this price point, but we can atleast expect something better than the previous mi earphones which were priced same. But this one doesn't stand at par with older mi earphones of rs.700...
You don't feel any better sound quality which feels like dual driver. Sound is not crystal clear, tends more towards warmer style. Feels too heavy to your ears.
Plus the mic was a biggest turn-off. You cannot just keep it hanging freely and talk, you have to hold it near your mouth, only then the other person can hear you a bit...

"I have used many earphone in this price range, so i am qualified to give an honest review. So here it is.... I genuinely loved the surround sound it provides...... if you want high and enhanced base, good surround sound and high gaming performance this is earphone for you, dual driver really helps you there. But if you want a balanced and clear sound, clear vocals then u should go for seinnheiser cx series.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Sound- Boosted sub bass so you can use Equalizer to bring down sub bass by 5-6 db . Other than they are quite good for the price. Very nice separation and you get good detail in the songs. Great for acoustic songs.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Okay,4.0 out of 5 stars
"Bass is less comparing with the previous version of MI which is now costs RS 700.
Totally disappointed with the sound and base effect.
Even the boat 152 for Rs 500 has more base and sound. MI just increased the price to Rs800 only for the magnet. Even the single driver MI earphone has more sound and bass effect.",3.0 out of 5 stars

Little bit uncomfortable (ear pain ) overall good quality sound good,4.0 out of 5 stars
I bought this headphones on November and i think the expiry period for this product is just 5-6 months exactly as the other reviews say..... One side of the headphones stopped working exactly after 6 months.... Buying an headphone for 800rs and having it to work properly only for 5-6 months is not worthy of the price,1.0 out of 5 stars

"I am writing this review.....as my 'return product' got closed 2 days before, and till today I was trying my best to solve the issue. The headphone sound quality is good, clarity is good, but the problem I am facing with the connecting 3.5 mm jack. It does not fit properly and come out automatically.... I have to keep my thumb on the connecting jack continuously, so that it does not get pop out. I have even changed my mobile cover; thinking that it might be an issue. But I got really disappointed that ..if is does not get fit properly and frequently comes out..then how can I say..i m using the headphone seamlessly. This kind of problem .. i never faced even in 50 rs headphone..so for 799 Rs... i did not expect this.

Very well built
Has 3 button controller with good mic

This is an highly overrated product company marketed this like this is a game changer and you are getting the product that you have paid for but to be speaking very honestly the sound quality of this earphone is not that really great the bass does not even feel real but there is a way that you can make this sound more better by using any sound or audio amplifier or enhancer.,2.0 out of 5 stars
